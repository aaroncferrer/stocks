## Overview
A comprehensive application for traders to manage their stock investments efficiently. This project is developed as part of our coursework at Avion School for the backend course.

[Demo Link](https://stocks-app-arcf.vercel.app/)

## Features
ðŸ“Œ **Fetching Stock Data**: We fetch real-time stock data from a third-party API, Phisix API, to populate our database.

ðŸ“Œ **Testing**: We've followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and achieved a test coverage of approximately 98% using RSpec and SimpleCov.

ðŸ“Œ **Mobile Responsiveness**: Our app is designed to be mobile-responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for both tablet and mobile device users.

ðŸ“Œ **Authentication & Authorization**: We use Bcrypt for secure password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

ðŸ“Œ **Email Notifications**: Trader Mailer is implemented for sending important email notifications to traders.

ðŸ“Œ **Database**: We've utilized PostgreSQL as our database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

ðŸ“Œ **Deployment**: The backend is deployed on Render, and the frontend is deployed through Vercel.

## Setup

2. Install Ruby on Rails dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Start PostgreSQL service: `sudo service postgresql start`
4. Create the database and run migrations: `rails db:create` `rails db:migrate`
5. Start the background task for fetching stock data: `rails fetch_stocks:all`

#### Scheduled Stock Updates

To automatically refresh stock data at intervals, you can optionally start the cron service: `sudo service cron start`

### Frontend

1. Clone the frontend repository.
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for API URLs in your `.env` file. You may need to use local storage for the host in your React app.
4. Start the React development server: `npm run dev`
